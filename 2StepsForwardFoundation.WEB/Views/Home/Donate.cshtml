<p>
        The 2 Steps Forward Foundation strives to give back as much as possible to the Charlotte area community. 
    As such it is our goal to give 90% of our incoming donations to the recipients of our financial grants. 
    The remaining funds are used for our administrative costs and to fund events designed to increase donations. 
    We are able to give so much back thanks to our fully volunteer staff. On behalf of our grant recipients the 2 Steps Forward Foundation would like to THANK YOU for your contribution.
